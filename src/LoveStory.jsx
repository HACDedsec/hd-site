          <p>
            I still remember seeing your smile for the first time. It was the most beautiful thing Iâ€™d ever seen, and
            since that day, youâ€™re the only person I want to see every day.<br />
            Youâ€™re my dream girl, and being with you feels like the luckiest thing in the world.<br />
            From that day, my love for you has only grown. When you held my hand for the first time, it felt like I had
            everything I ever needed. All I want is to see you happy, hold you close, and stay in the most peaceful
            placeâ€”your arms. Youâ€™re my happiness, my home, my everything.<br />
            I will forever love you, my sweetest, most wonderful love. Forever yours, my sweet, sweet lovely sweetuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ðŸ’–
